how are antibodies used in	An antibody ( Ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses .	1	0.7480566501617432
how are antibodies used in	The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target , called an antigen .	1	0.6363116502761841
how are antibodies used in	Each tip of the `` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( a structure analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision .	1	0.6865565776824951
how are antibodies used in	Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) .	1	0.6841952204704285

how are antibodies used in	Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable , allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures , or antigen binding sites , to exist .	0	0.7198727130889893
how are antibodies used in	This region is known as the hypervariable region .	0	0.7056782245635986
how are antibodies used in	Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen .	0	0.6702306270599365
how are antibodies used in	This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens .	0	0.685599148273468
how are antibodies used in	The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites ( or paratopes ) , followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene , which create further diversity .	0	0.7522503137588501
how are antibodies used in	Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another , creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region .	0	0.7136987447738647
how are antibodies used in	This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system .	0	0.6720067858695984

WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability is measured by estimating the relative contributions of genetic and non-genetic differences to the total phenotypic variation in a population .	0	0.7724713683128357
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability is an important concept in quantitative genetics , particularly in selective breeding and behaviour genetics ( for instance twin studies ) , but is less widely used in population genetics .	0	0.6625280380249023
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability measures the fraction of phenotype variability that can be attributed to genetic variation .	0	0.5719286203384399
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	This is not the same as saying that this fraction of an individual phenotype is caused by genetics .	0	0.5776618719100952
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	In addition , heritability can change without any genetic change occurring ( e.g . when the environment starts contributing to more variation ) .	0	0.585050106048584
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	A case in point , consider that both genes and environment have the potential to influence intelligence .	0	0.5990362167358398
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability could increase if genetic variation increases , causing individuals to show more phenotypic variation ( e.g . to show different levels of intelligence ) .	0	0.5424341559410095
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	On the other hand , heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases , causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation ( e.g . to show more similar levels of intelligence ) .	0	0.5394283533096313
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Heritability is increasing because genetics are contributing more variation , or because non-genetic factors are contributing less variation ; what matters is the relative contribution .	0	0.568874716758728
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Here we see why heritability is specific to a particular population in a particular environment .	0	0.5622475147247314
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	The extent of dependence of phenotype on environment can also be a function of the genes involved .	0	0.5797715187072754
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Matters of heritability are complicated because genes may canalize a phenotype , making its expression almost inevitable in all occurring environments .	0	0.5726954936981201
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Individuals with the same genotype can also exhibit different phenotypes through a mechanism called phenotypic plasticity , which makes heritability difficult to measure in some cases .	0	0.5595472455024719
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	Recent insights in molecular biology have identified changes in transcriptional activity of individual genes associated with environmental changes .	0	0.6857390403747559
WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS	However , there are a large number of genes whose transcription is not affected by the environment .	0	0.5853554606437683
