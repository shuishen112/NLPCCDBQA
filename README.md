This is a tensorflow implementation of  NLPCC2017 DBQA task. Our result ranks 5th amoung the 21 submission.

[Enhanced Embedding based Attentive Pooling Network for Answer Selection](http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2017/)

We utilize chinese wiki corpus to train our embedding. You can train embedding by youself or contact us to get what we use.

## Requirements

- python3

- Tensorflow = 1.12

## Training


```
./train.py --overlap_needed True --position_needed True
```
